Snowman

Objectives
* Reinforce component architecture in React
* Effective use props and state in React
Requirements
- - - - - - -
We're going to build a sort of reverse hangman. The player can't lose; they just get to build a snowman by adding parts each time they guess a letter correctly.

You will need to download these files and add them to your project:

1. Word List
2. Snowman Images (Unzip these before adding to your project)
## Explorer Mode ##
- [ ] Selects a random word from the list and display a number of blank spaces (or underscores) equal to the word length.
- [ ] Display a list of letters, A through Z as clickable buttons.
- [ ] When the player guesses a letter (clicks the button):
  - [ ] All instances of that letter are revealed at their corresponding positions in the word.
  - [ ] The button becomes disabled, as it has already been guessed.
  - [ ] Display the snowman image that corresponds with the number of letters revealed in the word.
## Adventure Mode ##
- [ ] After the word has been completed, offer the player to play again. Reset the state of the game without a page reload.
## Epic Mode ##
Refactor the game to play like a traditional "hangman" game:

- [ ] If the chosen letter is not part of the word, the snowman "grows"; increase a counter by one for each incorrect guess.
- [ ] If the snowman is completed (counter reaches 7) before the word is completed, the player loses, and the snowman wins.
